# OpenStruc:
OpenStruc: Static Analysis of Two- and Three-dimensional Structures
Version 1.0

**OpenStruc** is a computer program for the static analysis of two- and three-dimensional structures. **OpenStruc** can be used to analyze several types of structures: plane trusses and frames, space trusses and frames, and grids -- plane structures with loads applied orthogonally to their plane. 

**OpenStruc** is written entirely in C++. At its core, **OpenStruc** uses a direct solver algorithm based on Gauss Elimination, including a variation of the *Active Column Solution* method.

**OpenStruc** includes a plotting subsystem that utilizes a header file "matplotlibcpp.h" from the **matplotlib-cpp** project (See https://github.com/lava/matplotlib-cpp). **matplotlib-cpp** resembles the plotting API used by Matlab and matplotlib. Therefore, please have a working **Python** system and the **numpy** and **matplotlib** libraries installed.

Welcome to **OpenStruc**. Thank you for using it! 

# Requirements

- `C++ compiler`
- `cmake`
- `python, numpy, matplotlib`
- `matplotlibcpp.h` 

# Build Instructions

1. Make a build directory

```bash
mkdir build 
```

2. move to the build directory
```bash
cd build 
```

3. Build OpenStruc
```bash
cmake ..
```

4. Make OpenStruc
```bash
make 
```

# Run an example

The most common mode of running OpenStruc is by reading its commands from an input
script file. For example, you can instruct **OpenStruc** to execute one of the examples included in the `Examples` directory:

```
$ OpenStruc Examples/spaceFrame.dat [outputFileName]
```

For extended instruction on how to run **OpenStruc**, take a look at the *user_Guide_OpenStruc.pdf* included in this distribution.


# Check your solution
In the `Solutions` directory, you will find an output file for each of the input files located in the Examples directory.
